         <p>Straight to the Point Archery is a nonprofit archery education center founded in 2005 by Giap Nguyen.</p> 
          <br>
         <p>He's an avid and accomplished archer himself, having competed with the United States Archery Team in the 2000 Summer Olympics. He has three children and started Straight to the Point in part because he was not satisfied with the archery education options for them in Tacoma, WA. After the Hunger Games books and movies came out, he noticed a surge in the popularity of archery among young people, especially young women, and the business has been booming ever since.</p>
